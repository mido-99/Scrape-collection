#########	Siblings	###########

+ selects the next sibling element. (only directly sibling)
~ selects all subsequent sibling elements that match the selector.

So ~ is more general

#########	nth 	###########

:nth-of-type(2)
Selects only the second child of its parent

:nth-of-type(n-1)
Selects all elements except the first child of their parent

:nth-of-type(n+1)
Selects all elements starting from the second child of their parent 

:nth-of-type(2n)
Selects every second child of its parent

:nth-of-type(odd)
Selects all odd-numbered children of its parent

:nth-of-type(even)
Selects all even-numbered children of its parent

######### 	Children 	#############

The > direct child is extremely important; it made my head spin around for many hours before finding out that it must be used

Without it the tags were found regardless of their relation to parent

section_headers = table.select('tr:nth-child(2) > th')
section_headers = table.select('tr:nth-child(2) th')

Imagine that both of these select differently


.stripped_strings
When an element has many children each with text; we can retrieve them separtely using this
NOTE it returns a generator. If you want'em in list:
ls = list(elem.stripped_strings)
or
ls = [txt for txt in elem.stripped_strings]

######### Matching attribute that "contains" ########

To find an element whose attr (A) contains the string (aaa) we use A*.

Ex:
.show-grid [class*="span"]
It's an attribute wildcard selector. In the sample you've given, it looks for any child element under .show-grid that has a class that CONTAINS span.

another:
soup.select('div.Layout-sc-1xcs6mc-0.ivrFkx div[data-a-target*=live]')
selects all divs who are children of the parent div; with data-a-target CONTAINS "live"
