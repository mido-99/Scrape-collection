[Q & A
-----](#q---a_body)### How to find the ID or the shortlink of a card in Trello

If you want to edit a card or create a new comment, you must know the card's ID or shortlink. You can get this information from the output of the *New Card* trigger. The shortlink for a card can also be obtained by opening the card and clicking the *Share* button. The shortlink can be found in the **Link to this card** box at the end of the URL after `https://trello.com/c/.`

Board, list, and comment IDs can only be obtained using triggers. The [trello.com](https://trello.com/) website does not show these IDs.
