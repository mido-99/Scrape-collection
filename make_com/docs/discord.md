Discord
=======

The Discord modules allow you to create, update, list, and/or delete channels, channel messages, reactions, and webhooks in your Discord account.

To get started with Discord, create an account at [https://discordapp.com/register](https://discordapp.com/register?).

### Note

[According to Discord](https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404772028055-Message-Content-Privileged-Intent-FAQ), message content will be categorized as **Privileged Intent** starting September 1, 2022.

This means that users who have installed our verified bot on their Discord server will not be able to use the following Make modules with the bot:

* Watch Channel Messages
* List Channel Messages
* Get a Message
Users who installed the Make verified bot to connect to the Discord app on our platform will see the empty values of messages that the channel member sends for the fields, **content**, **embeds**, **attachments**, and **components** in the output.

The Make verified bot is still able to receive the messages for the above modules under the following conditions:

* Messages the bot sends
* Messages the bot receives in DMs
* Messages in which the bot is mentioned
If you want to use the aforementioned modules, you can [create a custom connection using a separate client ID](discord.html#connect-to-discord-using-oauth2-and-your-own-credentials "Connect to Discord using OAuth2 and your own credentials").

Connect Discord to Make
-----------------------

You can connect the Discord app to Make in two ways:

* [Connect using OAuth2](discord.html#connect-discord-to-make-using-oauth2 "Connect Discord to Make using OAuth2")
* [Connect using OAuth2 and using your own app credentials](discord.html#connect-to-discord-using-oauth2-and-your-own-credentials "Connect to Discord using OAuth2 and your own credentials")
Connect Discord to Make using OAuth2
------------------------------------

To connect your Discord account to Make, you need to create a server and channels.

1. Login to your Discord account and create a server.

1. Log in to the [Discord developer account](https://discord.com/developers/).
2. Click **Create New Application**, enter a name for the application, and click **Create**.
