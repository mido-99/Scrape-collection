Follow **Step 1** in the [Creating a scenario](https://www.integromat.com/en/help/creating-a-scenario) article (choose the **Telegram Bot** module instead of Twitter and Facebook module).

![61d6a9efb1ac0.png](./../image/uuid-ff7cc380-739c-abbb-8580-209367e5b79b.png)After the module is added to your scenario you can then see the *[Scenario editor](https://www.integromat.com/en/help/scenario-editor).*

Define what function you need your module to have. Here you can choose between three [types of modules](https://www.integromat.com/en/help/types-of-modules) â€“ *Triggers,* *Actions,* and *Searches.*

Troubleshooting
---------------

Check the following procedures if you are facing difficulties when using the Telegram bot app.

### How to find out the ID of a private channel/group:

One possible way to determine the ID of a private channel/group is as follows:

1. Create a new scenario
2. Place Telegram Bot >; Watch updates module in the scenario.
3. Configure the module by creating a webhook.
4. Execute the scenario.
5. Send a message to the private channel/group.
6. Verify the output of the module by clicking the bubble above the module.
7. Find the ID in the output bundle:

![2020-04-08-13_11_38-window.png](./../image/uuid-2eb5f5f1-88eb-250e-082e-2b273c540884.png)
### How to find out the user ID

To find out the ID of a Telegram user, forward their message to the **userinfobot**. Check out the following procedure for steps on how to do that:

1. Add the **userinfobot** to your Telegram app. You can do that by entering `@userinfobot` in the search bar and selecting the **userinfobot**.

![61d6b8959380c.gif](./../image/uuid-065f8e7b-39f9-3de5-8198-507b827e4e02.gif)
2. Go to the chat with the user you want to retrieve the ID from.
3. Forward his message to **userinfobot.**
4. Copy the User ID and paste it to the Make module.

![61d6b8978bfee.png](./../image/uuid-6a10ce31-221e-5b94-aef4-bc6d7a8b93d1.png)
### Adding Your Bot To the Channel:

1. Click the right mouse button on the channel name and select the *View channel info* option*.*
2. Click the *Add Member* icon next to the member number.

![61d6b89d19e85.png](./../image/uuid-05d46f27-b331-f859-4cba-12a7db02453c.png)
3. Start typing the name of your bot in the search field.
4. Click on the bot name to select the bot you want to add to the channel.

![61d6b89e298b1.png](./../image/uuid-913c4f24-ee0b-843a-2a3f-ab518d97e0d1.png)
5. Click the *INVITE* button.
6. Make the bot admin by clicking the respective button.

![61d6b89f18ca8.png](./../image/uuid-6a89ecdf-52c5-56c9-fd02-adcdc9f5f718.png)
7. Assign the permissions to your bot and click the *SAVE* button.

![61d6b89ff2684.png](./../image/uuid-1c3f8f03-baaf-1297-73af-eab190d72999.png)
The bot has been added to the channel.

### Testing a Public Channel

To test the public channel you need to obtain the *Chat ID.* The *Chat ID* is part of the channel link.

The *channel name* is **NOT** the channel *link*/*chat ID.*

If the public channel link is, for example, *t.me/IMTtest*, then `@IMTtest` is your ***Chat ID***.

![61d6b8a0e693f.png](./../image/uuid-1c64c350-71a9-8b66-bdd3-dc3b8ff08e02.png)Now, you can send a message to the public channel using the *Send a Text Message or a Reply* module.

![61d6b8a1c71bd.png](./../image/uuid-daeb0cb8-a30a-3d3c-a8ac-064a22632779.png)### Testing a Private Channel:

You need to obtain the Chat ID to test the private channel. There are three options to retrieve the ID:

* [Retrieve the ID from the web version of Telegram](telegram-bot.html#retrieving-the-id-from-the-web-version-of-telegram "Retrieving the ID From the Web Version of Telegram").
* Switch the private channel to the public channel, then retrieve the ID (by sending or receiving the message in Make) and switch back the channel type to *private*.
* Invite the bot `get_id_bot` to your private channel and using the `/my_id@get_id_bot` command.
### Retrieving the ID From the Web Version of Telegram

1. Log in to your Telegram account via [https://web.telegram.org](https://web.telegram.org/).
2. Click on the private channel you want to retrieve the chat ID for.

![61d6b8a2d953a.png](./../image/uuid-c7d9f9a7-7f28-fd3c-4b8b-716cc343f9ce.png)
3. Copy the number between the c letter and the underscore from the URL. If the URL is https://web.telegram.org/#/im?p=c1424271061\_11793697872942794544 then copy the 1424271061

![61d6b8a3cf316.png](./../image/uuid-318f36b7-9cb2-bc3e-6bcb-23f8467c47c0.png)
4. Paste the number to the desired field and **add the prefix**`-100`
5. The Chat ID of the private channel is then **-100***1424271061.*

You can now use the *ID* in the desired *Telegram Bot* module in *Make*.

![61d6b8a4cde72.png](./../image/uuid-f652a43a-fe3c-ec8d-a980-63d6e94eb4d7.png)
### Registration and Login

It is not required. You can sign in on the site, [telegram.org/auth](https://my.telegram.org/auth) where you can change your public settings. You will receive a key in your desktop application to submit your login.

### My bot is hitting limits, how do I avoid this?

When sending messages inside a particular chat, avoid sending more than one message per second. We may allow short bursts that go over this limit, but eventually you'll begin receiving 429 errors.

If you're sending bulk notifications to multiple users, the API will not allow more than 30 messages per second or so. Consider spreading out notifications over large intervals of 8â€”12 hours for best results.

Also note that your bot will not be able to send more than 20 messages per minute to the same group.
