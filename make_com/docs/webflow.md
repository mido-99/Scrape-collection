Webflow
=======

With Webflow modules in Make, you can manage the collections, items, products, orders, inventory, asset folders, and pages in your Webflow account.

To get started with Webflow, create an account at [webflow.com](https://webflow.com/dashboard/signup).

Refer to the [Webflow API documentation](https://developers.webflow.com/reference/) for a list of available endpoints.

Connect Webflow to Make
-----------------------

To establish the connection:

1. Log in to your Make account, add a Webflow module to your scenario, and click **Create a Connection**.
2. Optional: In the **Connection name** field, enter a name for the connection.
3. Optional: Click **Show Advanced Settings** and enter your custom app's client credentials. To create a custom app, refer to [Webflow OAuth2.0: App Registration documentation](https://developers.webflow.com/docs/oauth).

Note: If requested, use the following information when creating a custom app: `https://www.integromat.com/oauth/cb/webflow2`
4. Click **Save**.
5. If prompted, log in to your account and confirm the access.

You have successfully established the connection. You can now edit your scenario and add more Webflow modules. If your connection requires reauthorization at any point, follow the connection renewal steps [here](https://www.make.com/en/help/connections/connecting-to-services.html).
