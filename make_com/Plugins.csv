Build Airtable Scenarios
------------------------

After connecting the app, you can perform the following actions:

Records
-------

You can watch, create, update, search, retrieve, upsert, delete records, and watch responses using the following modules.

[### Watch Records](#watch-records-964541_body)Returns all newly created or updated records in a view (required **Created Time** or **Last Modified Time** fields).



| **Connection** | Establish a connection to your Airtable account. |
| --- | --- |
| **Base** | Select the base that contains the table you want to watch for records. |
| **Table** | Select the table you want to watch for new records. |
| **Trigger configuration** | **Trigger field**Select the `Created Time` option to watch for new records or the `Last Modified Time` option to watch for modified records.If you do not have a `Created Time` or `Last Modified Time` field in your scheme, we ask you to create one. Without this field, the trigger will not work correctly.61d5a7b5d47d6.gif**Label field**: used as a label for a record. For example, **Status** dialog.Airtable_trigger_field.png |
| **Limit** | The maximum number of records Make will return during one execution cycle. |
| **View** | Select the view to watch the records. If selected, it will return the records only in that view. |
| **Formula** | Enter the formula to filter records. For more details, refer to the [Formula field reference documentation](https://support.airtable.com/hc/en-us/articles/203255215-Formula-Field-Reference).The formula will be evaluated for each record, and if the result is not `0`, `false`, `""""`, `NaN`, `[]`, or `#Error!`, includes the record in the response.If combined with the `view` parameter, it returns only records in that view that satisfy the formula.For example, to only include records where Name isn't empty, pass in `NOT({Name} = '')` as a parameter like this:`filterByFormula=NOT%28%7BName%7D%20%3D%20%27%27%29` |
| **Use Column ID** | Select whether to use column ID instead of column name for mapping.This enables persistence over the column name change. Enabling this option allows to replace entity keys in the response; instead of entity names specified as parameter keys, their identifiers will be specified. Changing this value will break all existing mappings in this scenario. |

[### Watch Responses](#watch-responses_body)Triggers when a new response is submitted.

### Warning

Available for paid ***Pro Plan*** only. See the [Airtable pricing page](https://airtable.com/pricing).

The webhook URL needs to be generated in Make and added to the form configuration in the Airtable.

1. Add the Watch Responses module to your Makescenario.
2. Generate and copy the webhook URL.

![Airtable_webhook_.gif](./../image/uuid-5a6a77e8-25b0-c132-69df-c7fc07884beb.gif)
3. Log in to your Airtable account.
4. Open the *Base* and the *table* you want for the form and create a *Form view*.

![61d5a7c07e2c4.gif](./../image/uuid-01a1e015-be71-4fe8-2e70-4d3fa0513e4b.gif)
5. Set the form as needed, scroll down the form, and enable the *Redirect to URL after the form is submitted* option.

![61d5a7c446f88.png](./../image/uuid-0ba91ca6-9ad3-a057-2abb-c80c87a32697.png)
6. Enter the Webhook URL generated in step 2 to the displayed dialog box and add the *?record\_id={record\_id}* just after the webhook URL to include the *Record ID* in the module's output, then click Save. The resulting URL will, for example, look like this:

*https://hook.eu1.make.com/tgnp28pewooafbdgobvbh225hmocbn85?record\_id={record\_id}*

![61d5a7c61cdbc.png](./../image/uuid-61bd60c6-982a-4816-a0ba-b2a384f4f1b6.png)
7. Go back to your Makescenario and run the *Watch Responses* module **only** to load the Record ID from Airtable and to be able to map that field into the other modules.

Note: Airtable only supports sending the `record_id` parameter.
8. Submit the form in Airtable where the *Redirect to URL after the form is submitted* option is enabled and the Webhook URL is added (step 6 above).

The Watch Responses module is triggered and loads the Record ID.

![61d5a7c7b5df4.gif](./../image/uuid-7d8fed27-06f7-091f-9a46-4d59df4ecdf6.png)
9. Add the *Airtable > Get a Record* module just after the *Airtable > Watch Responses* module and map the *record\_id* to the *Record ID* field.

![Airtable_record_ID.png](./../image/uuid-329e4c78-3f76-ee21-59ad-ddf47bc2ff5f.png)
Every time the form is submitted, the *Watch Responses* module in your Makescenario is triggered, and the *Get a Record* module returns the submitted form details.
